<p>
 
I'm Tim!

 
<hr/>

 

 
 
I'm a positive person who is fascinated by ideas and new concepts, someone who is excited to continously improve, and someone who loves a good challange. I'm highly motivated by learning and I am always searching out new projects and activities.

 
 
 <br/>
 
 
 
‚ö° Fun fact: *I've worked with software for a long time, starting with game development with the Unity Game Engine, but I developed an extremely strong interest and passion after taking a **good knock to the noggin**. Yes, I'm fine (thankfully) and have only had minor side-effects from this.*

> What's with the username?

 
<br/>

 
I like coffee, I get up super early, and I started using it with no other thoughts or reason behind it! I needed a new username I thought it up while drinking my morning coffee! 

 

‚ö° Fun fact: *The duck is a rubber duck I received as a gift! I like that little guy.*

<br/>
 
NO!
 
<br/>
<br/> 

> Why not?
 
 <br/>
 
 I'm a busy fella! So please keep in mind there's a lot more to show off than what's on here and I can provide context on request.

<h3>What work do I currently do?</h3>


<hr/>


 
<p>
 
 I am currently working as a part of a skilled research and development team who creates educational automotive training electronics. This includes creating desktop software, embedded programs for microcontrollers, hardware systems, and the integration of real modules from vehicles (such as the BCM, or Body Control Module) and making them work outside of their networks.

 
 <br/>
 
   
One of my favorite challanges I've worked on so far! It's a simulation of celestial gravity using physics formulas and implements a level of detail system and procedural generation for the celestial bodies! 


 <br/>
 
 
Some others would include using the marching cubes algorithm to create 3D landscapes/areas and creating electronic puzzle boxes using AVR, PIC, and whatever thrift stores have that can be used to make an enjoyable puzzle!
