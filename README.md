### Hi, I'm Tim.


#### Who am I?


I'm a positive person who is fascinated by ideas and new concepts, someone who is excited to continously improve, and someone who loves a good challange. I'm highly motivated by learning and I am always searching out new projects and activities.



âš¡ Fun fact: *I've worked with software for a long time, starting with game development with the Unity Game Engine, but I developed an extremely strong interest and passion after taking a **good knock to the noggin**. Yes, I'm fine, the only side effects I've noticed is a slightly decreased short term memory and things similar to that.*



### What work do I currently do?


I am currently working as a part of a skilled research and development team who creates educational automotive training electronics. This includes creating desktop software, embedded programs for microcontrollers, hardware systems, and the integration of real modules from vehicles (such as the BCM, or Body Control Module) and making them work outside of their networks.



For personal projects, I often explore the concept of randomness in computer science(it's interesting), work on small game development projects, and work on any interesting projects I can think of.




Here's one of my favorite challanges I've worked on so far! It's a simulation of celestial gravity using physics formulas and implements a level of detail system and procedural generation for the celestial bodies!
