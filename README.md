> What's with the username?

 
<br/>

 
I like coffee, I get up super early, and I started using it with no other thoughts or reason behind it! I needed a new username While drinking my morning coffee I thought "hmm...I'm groggy and I'm a software engineer...". This was a real interview question I've gotten once, hopefully this answers it.

 

‚ö° Fun fact: *The duck is a rubber debug duck I received as a gift! I like that little guy, his name is Ronnie the Rubber Debug Duck.*

NO!

> Why not?
 
 <br/>
 
I'm a busy fella! So please keep in mind there's a lot more to show off than what's on here and I can provide context on request. I honestly haven't had enough time for github projects as I work early, get off late, and drive a good distance but this is something I'm trying to adjust. I enjoy creating things and it's a priority for my to share some of the things I make.

<h3>What work do I currently do?</h3>


<hr/>


 
<p>
 
I am currently working as the software engineer in a skilled research and development team who creates automotive training electronics. This includes creating applications, embedded programs, advanced automotive hardware systems, and the integration (and recreation) of advanced modules from vehicles. These tasks require data acquisition (especially those related to safety), signal processing, creating drivers for various components, and much more. My job allows me to explore many aspects of STEM, UI/UX/HI, and experiment with new and interesting things. I would have never learned how to manage high pressure systems, use RADAR, or how to recreate everything within motor vehicles if it wasn't for this position. The programs and the hardware are both highly sensitive as well as very proprietary, so do not expect to see things from these projects on my github.

 
 <br/>
 
 <h3>Personal</h3>
 
 <hr/>
 
 
 
In my personal time, I enjoy working on software, electronics, 3D modeling (and printing), game development, art projects, and just generally making things. My favorite programming languages are C, C++, and C# but I have experience with others as well. C, C++, and Assembly has given me the knowledge to easily learn new programming languages and computer science topics but I'll be honest... I'm not the biggest fan of writing programs exclusively in Assembly unless it's for a fun challange. 

<br/>



<br/>

I love video game development, since it lets me explore computer science, physics, rendering, art, music, and plenty of other topics while making a product whose final purpose is fun. I love embedded development because it's fun and makes me feel like an inventor.

 
 
 <br/>
 
 
 Currently, I've been working on some procedural world, civilization, and history generation using Unity. This project is very inspired by The Hobbit and Dwarf Fortress. The ability to be able to create worlds full of lore and adventure really excites me.


 
 <br/>
   
One of my favorite personal challanges I've worked on so far? It's a simulation of celestial gravity using physics formulas and procedural generation for the celestial bodies! This one still just sticks out to me even though there's been many others.


 <br/>
 
 
In relation to embedded systems, another fun thing I do is create electronic puzzle boxes using AVR, PIC, Raspberry PI, and whatever thrift stores have that can be used to make an enjoyable puzzle!
